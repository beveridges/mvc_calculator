Why do we need to manually identify MVC bursts? \u00b6 You would think that a process like burst identification could be pefromed automatically. However, during the first drum study we ended up with files that were so irregular, they couldn\u2019t be processed automatically. Examples of such irregularities include files with more bursts than required (due to false starts or miscounting), multiple files for the same participant, and noise. By allowing the user to manually define MVC bursts, the MVC Calculator provides a method that is reliable, repeatable, and valid . Summary For all intents and purposes using MVC Calculator is one-and-done process. MATLAB .mat files go in, and an XML file with the MVC values comes out. This will probably be the case 90% of the time. The other 10% can be a pain. MVC Calculator makes dealing with this 10% much more painless. How MVC calculator fits into the workflow. \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 There are currently two builds for Windows and one for Linux. These can be found at https://downloads.moviolabs.com/MVC_Calculator/releases/ . The Windows portable version doesn\u2019t require installtion, but can be slower on startup. The installable version (.msi) is faster because it does most of the time consuming heavy lifting only once during installation. Note During the alpha phase of development MVC Calculator will run with a temporary terminal in the background. This is designed as a troubleshooting tool and should mimic what is shown in the console . of MVC Calculator. Features \u00b6 MATLAB\u00ae .mat file importer Detect and visualize MVC bursts interactively Export processed MVC results data to XML Import XML Adjustable burst thresholds detection function Built-in logging and data management # Overview of the MVC Calculation and implementation The following asteps outline the entire process on implemeneting MVC single normalisation Quick Start \u00b6 Four (or six, depending on the sensor configuration) , .mat files are loaded into the software Open MVC Calculator and load your .mat file from the recording system recorded by Qualisys or Noraxon systems. Use the Energy Detection tool to locate candidate MVC bursts. Fine-tune burst regions using the graphical selector. Press Save Results to store computed MVC metrics. Measurement Protocol By default, MVC Calculator assumes two things: We are following the \u201cbest of 3\u201d procedure (Konrad, 2005). The sEMG sampling frequency is 1500Hz. These settings can be modified by changing the defaults Measurement Protocol Suggestions \u00b6 Perform three maximum-effort trials for each muscle group. Allow sufficient rest (\u2265 30 seconds) between trials. Ensure consistent electrode placement across sessions. Use the same sampling frequency for all measurements. The Interface \u00b6 The interface for MVC Calculator is very simple. It comprises: Menu bar Plotting area Console Main UI controls MVC Calculator UI Quick Start \u00b6 What follows are thea series of videos demonstrating the primary functions of MVC Calculator Scenario 1: Performing the MVC Calculation \u00b6 Making an MVC Calculation is very straight forward, it involves: Importing MATLAB\u00ae files Selecting bursts in the sEMG signal Performing the calculation Exportiong the saved data The following video will demonstrate this process. MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 2: Performing a batch MVC Calculation \u00b6 The majority of the time you will be processing multiple files (In our case four or six sensors). The following video demonstrates this process. The selection of single sEMG bursts is exactly the same as above except there are multiple tabs so multiple selections shoudl be made. Note that the tabs that have not had an active selection will show a red dot when the batchg MVV calculation MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 3: Importing an XML file \u00b6 XML is the format the system uses to save MVC calculations MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Changing the Defaults \u00b6 You can change the defaults mentioned above by modifying the relative path ./config/defaults.py . Just open the file in any text editor and modify the two numbers corresponding to BEST_OF and DEFAULT_SEMG_FREQUENCY . Tip You can change the \u201cbest of X\u201d rule in the configuration file: ./config/defaults.py \u2192 variable BEST_OF . Note Noraxon / Qualisys record all sensors by default. It\u2019s the user\u2019s responsibility to identify which sensors are relevant for MVC computation. References \u00b6 Konrad, P. (2005).
