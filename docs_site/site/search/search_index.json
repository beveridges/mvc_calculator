Why do we need manually identify MVC bursts? \u00b6 You would think that a process like burst identification could be pefromed very easily automagically. However, during the first drum study we ended up with files that had more than 3 bursts (due to miscounting or false starts), multiple files for the same participant, and other assorted problems. By allowing the user to manually define MVC bursts, the MVC Calculator provides a method that is reliable, repeatable, and valid . For all intents and purposes using MVC Calculator is one-and-done process. MATLAB .mat files go in, and an XML file with the MVC values go out. This will probably be the case 90% of the time. The other 10% can be a pain. MVC Calculator makes dealing with the 10% WAY easier. Let\u2019s dive into a Quick Start. The Quick Start has the following assumptions: We are following the \u201cbest of 3\u201d procedure (Konrad, 2005). The sEMG sampling frequency is 1500Hz.

Use the Energy Detection tool to locate candidate MVC bursts. Fine-tune burst regions using the graphical selector.

It\u2019s the user\u2019s responsibility to identify which sensors are relevant for MVC computation. Measurement Protocol Suggestions \u00b6 Perform three maximum-effort trials for each muscle group. Allow sufficient rest (\u2265 30 seconds) between trials. Ensure consistent electrode placement across sessions. Use the same sampling frequency for all measurements. References \u00b6 Konrad, P.
