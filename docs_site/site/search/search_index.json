Why do we need to manually identify MVC bursts? \u00b6 You would think that a process like burst identification could be pefromed automatically. However, during the first drum study we ended up with files that were so irregular, they couldn\u2019t be processed automatically. Examples of such irregularities include files with more bursts than required (due to false starts or miscounting), multiple files for the same participant, and noise. By allowing the user to manually define MVC bursts, the MVC Calculator provides a method that is reliable, repeatable, and valid . Summary For all intents and purposes using MVC Calculator is one-and-done process. MATLAB .mat files go in, and an XML file with the MVC values comes out. This will probably be the case 90% of the time. The other 10% can be a pain. MVC Calculator makes dealing with this 10% much more painless. How MVC calculator fits into the workflow. \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 There are currently two builds for Windows and one for Linux. These can be found at https://downloads.moviolabs.com/MVC_Calculator/releases/ . The Windows portable version doesn\u2019t require installtion, but can be slower on startup. The installable version (.msi) is faster because it does most of the time consuming heavy lifting only once during installation. Note During the alpha phase of development MVC Calculator will run with a temporary terminal in the background. This is designed as a troubleshooting tool and should mimic what is shown in the console . of MVC Calculator. Features \u00b6 MATLAB \u00ae .mat file importer Detect and visualize MVC bursts interactively Export processed MVC results data to XML Import XML Adjustable burst thresholds detection function Built-in logging and data management Overview of the MVC Calculation and implementation \u00b6 The following asteps outline the entire process on implemeneting MVC single normalisation Quick Start \u00b6 Four (or six, depending on the sensor configuration) , .mat files are loaded into the software Open MVC Calculator and load your .mat file from the recording system recorded by QualisysAB \u00ae or Noraxon \u00ae systems. Use the Energy Detection tool to locate candidate MVC bursts. Fine-tune burst regions using the graphical selector. Press Save Results to store computed MVC metrics. Measurement Protocol By default, MVC Calculator assumes two things: We are following the \u201cbest of 3\u201d procedure (Konrad, 2005). The sEMG sampling frequency is 1500Hz. These settings can be modified by changing the defaults Measurement Protocol Suggestions \u00b6 Perform three maximum-effort trials for each muscle group. Allow sufficient rest (\u2265 30 seconds) between trials. Ensure consistent electrode placement across sessions. Use the same sampling frequency for all measurements. The Interface \u00b6 The interface for MVC Calculator is very simple. It comprises: Menu bar Plotting area Console Main UI controls MVC Calculator UI Quick Start \u00b6 What follows are thea series of videos demonstrating the primary functions of MVC Calculator Scenario 1: Performing the MVC Calculation \u00b6 Making an MVC Calculation is very straight forward, it involves: Importing MATLAB \u00ae files Selecting bursts in the sEMG signal Performing the calculation Exportiong the saved data The following video will demonstrate this process. MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 2: Performing a batch MVC Calculation \u00b6 The majority of the time you will be processing multiple files (In our case four or six sensors). The following video demonstrates this process. The selection of single sEMG bursts is exactly the same as above except there are multiple tabs so multiple selections shoudl be made. Note that the tabs that have not had an active selection will show a red dot when the batchg MVV calculation MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 3: Importing an XML file \u00b6 XML is the format the system uses to save MVC calculations MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Changing the Defaults \u00b6 You can change the defaults mentioned above by modifying the relative path ./config/defaults.py . Just open the file in any text editor and modify the two numbers corresponding to BEST_OF and DEFAULT_SEMG_FREQUENCY . Tip You can change the \u201cbest of X\u201d rule in the configuration file: ./config/defaults.py \u2192 variable BEST_OF . Note Noraxon \u00ae / QualisysAB \u00ae record all sensors by default.

Measurement Protocol By default, MVC Calculator assumes two things: We are following the \u201cbest of 3\u201d procedure (Konrad, 2005). The sEMG sampling frequency is 1500Hz. These settings can be modified by changing the defaults Measurement Protocol Suggestions \u00b6 Perform three maximum-effort trials for each muscle group. Allow sufficient rest (\u2265 30 seconds) between trials. Ensure consistent electrode placement across sessions. Use the same sampling frequency for all measurements. The Interface \u00b6 The interface for MVC Calculator is very simple. It comprises: Menu bar Plotting area Console Main UI controls MVC Calculator UI Quick Start \u00b6 What follows are thea series of videos demonstrating the primary functions of MVC Calculator Scenario 1: Performing the MVC Calculation \u00b6 Making an MVC Calculation is very straight forward, it involves: Importing MATLAB \u00ae files Selecting bursts in the sEMG signal Performing the calculation Exportiong the saved data The following video will demonstrate this process. MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 2: Performing a batch MVC Calculation \u00b6 The majority of the time you will be processing multiple files (In our case four or six sensors). The following video demonstrates this process. The selection of single sEMG bursts is exactly the same as above except there are multiple tabs so multiple selections shoudl be made. Note that the tabs that have not had an active selection will show a red dot when the batchg MVV calculation MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 3: Importing an XML file \u00b6 XML is the format the system uses to save MVC calculations MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Changing the Defaults \u00b6 You can change the defaults mentioned above by modifying the relative path ./config/defaults.py . Just open the file in any text editor and modify the two numbers corresponding to BEST_OF and DEFAULT_SEMG_FREQUENCY . Tip You can change the \u201cbest of X\u201d rule in the configuration file: ./config/defaults.py \u2192 variable BEST_OF . Note Noraxon \u00ae / QualisysAB \u00ae record all sensors by default.

However, during the first drum study we ended up with files that were so irregular, they couldn\u2019t be processed automatically. Examples of such irregularities include files with more bursts than required (due to false starts or miscounting), multiple files for the same participant, and noise. By allowing the user to manually define MVC bursts, the MVC Calculator provides a method that is reliable, repeatable, and valid . Summary For all intents and purposes using MVC Calculator is one-and-done process. MATLAB .mat files go in, and an XML file with the MVC values comes out. This will probably be the case 90% of the time. The other 10% can be a pain. MVC Calculator makes dealing with this 10% much more painless.","title":"Why do we need to manually identify MVC bursts?"},{"location":"index_OLD/#how-mvc-calculator-fits-into-the-workflow","text":"","title":"How MVC calculator fits into the workflow."},{"location":"index_OLD/#installation","text":"There are currently two builds for Windows and one for Linux.

What is MVC Calculator? \u00b6 MVC Calculator is software that provides a visual method of idenitfying and annotating bursts in sEMG signals. Why do we need to manually identify MVC bursts? \u00b6 You might expect a process like burst identification to be handled automatically by software. However, during the first drum study we encountered sEMG files that were too irregular for full automation. These irregularities included recordings with extra bursts (caused by false starts or miscounts), duplicate files for the same participant, and excessive noise. To address this, the MVC Calculator allows users to manually define MVC bursts, ensuring a method that is reliable, repeatable, and valid . Summary For all intents and purposes, using MVC Calculator is a one-and-done process: MATLAB .mat files go in, and an XML file with the MVC values comes out. In about 90% of cases, that\u2019s the entire workflow. The remaining 10% can be frustrating due to irregular or problematic files\u2014but MVC Calculator is designed to make handling that difficult 10% far more manageable. How MVC calculator fits into the experimental workflow \u00b6 The implementation of MVC signals is a two-stage process. Stage 1 \u00b6 First, sEMG signals representing the MVC are recorded using Noraxon \u00ae /QualisysAB \u00ae systems. These signals are then processed in MVC Calculator (see Figure 1 ). As noted earlier, the workflow can involve a combination of automatic and manual steps. Once the processing is complete, the final MVC values are saved in XML format. Figure 1: The Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) recording/calculation process. Stage 2 \u00b6 The MVC XML files are imported into Max , where they are used on-the-fly to normalize the incoming live sEMG signals. Once normalized, these signals are then used to drive the biofeedback system\u2014for example, to change the triggered sample. Figure 2 Figure 2: MVC values being used in Max.

This is intentional and serves as a troubleshooting aid, displaying the same diagnostic output shown in the application's console window (see Figure 3 ). Getting Started \u00b6 First Launch \u00b6 When you first launch MVC Calculator, you will see: Menu Bar - File and Help menus at the top Plotting Area - Large central area for visualizing sEMG signals Console - Bottom panel showing log messages and status Control Buttons - Main action buttons on the interface Figure 3: The MVC Calculator UI. Loading Your First File \u00b6 Click Import MAT files button or use Ctrl + L (or File \u2192 Import MAT files) Click the Select files button Select a .mat file Use the Import Files button to import the files The application will load and display your sEMG data in the plotting area. File Operations \u00b6 Importing MAT Files \u00b6 MVC Calculator supports MATLAB .mat files exported from the IMM QualisysAB \u00ae QTM / Noraxon \u00ae sEMG system. To load mat files: Click the Import MAT files button or use Ctrl + L (or File \u2192 Import MAT files) Click the Select files button Select one or more .mat files With the files selected, you can choose Remove Selected to delete only those files, or Clear Files to remove all files When you are happy with the siles you have selected, use the Import Files button The application will automatically detect and load the sEMG data Each file will appear as a separate tab in the plotting area Importing XML Files \u00b6 To load previously saved MVC calculations: Click the Import XML file button or use Ctrl + X (or File \u2192 Import XML file or use the shortcut ) Navigate to your saved .xml file Click Open This will restore your previous burst selections and calculated MVC values. Exporting Results \u00b6 After processing your data: Click Export XML file or use Ctrl + E (or File \u2192 Export XML file) Choose a location and filename Click Save The exported XML contains: Selected burst regions for each sensor Calculated MVC values Metadata (timestamps, file paths, etc.) Working with sEMG Data \u00b6 Understanding the User Interface \u00b6 When you load a .mat file, MVC Calculator displays: Signal Plot : The raw or processed sEMG signal over time Sensor Tabs : If multiple sensors are loaded, each appears as a tab Time Axis : Horizontal axis showing time in seconds Amplitude Axis : Vertical axis showing signal amplitude Navigating Multiple Sensors \u00b6 If you\u2019ve loaded multiple files (e.g., 4 or 6 sensors), the interface displays four key elements (see Figure 4 : Sensor Tabs \u2013 Each sensor appears as a tab at the top of the plotting area. EMG channel selection buttons \u2013 These highlighted buttons allow you to select the desired EMG channel. Clear all selections button \u2013 Clears any burst selections made in the active EMG channel. Active EMG channel \u2013 The currently selected sensor is highlighted with a bold rectangle around the corresponding plot. Figure 4: MVC Calculator interface displaying sEMG signals extracted from the loaded .mat files. IMPORTANT In most studies, each participant will be fitted with all sensors required by the measurement protocol (typically 4 or 6). As a result, every .mat file contains all sEMG channels for that recording, not just the target muscle. Occasionally, recording errors or mislabelling can make it unclear whether the sensor with the highest amplitude truly corresponds to the target muscle indicated by the filename. MVC Calculator provides a quick visual method to verify that the .mat filename matches the correct sensor channel for the intended muscle. When used alongside a well-defined experimental protocol, MVC Calculator greatly reduces uncertainty and ensures the correct pairing between sensor channels and muscle names. Signal Processing \u00b6 MVC Calculator automatically processes sEMG signals using: Bandpass Filtering : Removes noise outside the 10-500 Hz range (default) RMS Calculation : Computes root mean square for signal smoothing Hampel Filtering : Removes outliers and artifacts These processing steps are applied automatically when you load data. Burst Detection \u00b6 Auto burst detection tool \u00b6 The Auto burst detection tool automatically scans your signal and highlights regions that are likely to contain MVC bursts. To use the Auto burst detection tool you must: Use the EMG channel select button to make your channel selection Click the Auto burst detection button Three orange selections will be made automagically At this point, you can either Calculate MVC for the selected channel or refine the selections manually. Note Selection refinement is done by Shift-clicking to delete the current selection and creating a new one. Manual Burst Selection \u00b6 Click and Drag : Click on the plot and drag to select a burst region Visual Feedback : Selected regions are highlighted in orange Multiple Selections : Multiple bursts can be selected for each sensor. The selection limit is defined by the measurement protocol and managed through the BEST_OF variable. Remove a Single Selection : Shift-click (right) to remove a single selection Clear All Selections : Use the clear button to remove all selections Note MVC Calculator limits the number of bursts you can select. The default is 3 bursts, but you can change this by editing the BEST_OF variable in ./config/defaults.py. Processing and Calculations \u00b6 Understanding the MVC Calculation \u00b6 The MVC (Maximum Voluntary Contraction) calculation is performed in the following stages: The signal is processed, producing a value that represents muscle activity at each time point. For each selected burst region, this signal is divided into 500 ms windows. The mean value of each window is calculated, and the highest of these means is taken as the Maximum Contraction or Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) . Processing a single file \u00b6 With a single .mat file loaded (one tab) and your bursts selected: Review your selections in the plotting area Press the Calculate MVC button The software will then: Compute the MVC value (usually the mean amplitude of the highest 500 ms window, as described by Konrad, 2005) Output the results to the console Note If you only need the MVC values for this single sensor (one .mat file), you can now press Export XML file (or use File \u2192 Export XML file) to finish the process. Batch Processing \u00b6 Batch processing lets you run the MVC calculation across multiple sensors at once. Each sensor appears in a separate tab (one tab per .mat file), so you can easily navigate and verify the data before or after running the batch. Select bursts for each sensor Move through the tabs and repeat the steps described in Processing a single file for each .mat file. This involves reviewing the signal in the plotting area and selecting the required burst regions. Use the red indicators as a guide If you accidently press the Batch calculate MVC befaore all bursts are selectin in all tabs, tabs with red indicators show which sensors still require burst selections. Tabs lose the indicator once valid selections have been made (see Figure 5 Ensure all sensors have valid selections Batch processing can only begin once every sensor (every tab) has at least one valid burst selection. Click the Batch calculate MVC button Once all selections are complete, press the Batch calculate MVC button to run the MVC calculation for all sensors simultaneously. View results The software will: Compute the MVC value for each sensor independently Display the results in the console Prepare the output for export (e.g., XML file generation) Figure 5: If you forget to make a burst selection during batch processing, any tab without a valid selection is marked with a red dot. Note If you only need MVC values from one sensor (one .mat file), you may bypass batch processing and directly select Export XML file after computing MVC for that sensor. Exporting Results \u00b6 XML Export Format \u00b6 The XML export format is as follows: <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?> <MVCResults> <ExportInfo> <Date> 2025-12-06 </Date> <Time> 21:28:24 </Time> </ExportInfo> <File name= \"P05_MVC_Right_FLEX_DIG_SUP.mat\" > <Row> 3 </Row> <MVC> 804.7818496050679 </MVC> <Bursts> <Burst id= \"1\" > <Start> 16219 </Start> <End> 39555 </End> </Burst> <Burst id= \"2\" > <Start> 91265 </Start> <End> 115474 </End> </Burst> <Burst id= \"3\" > <Start> 196201 </Start> <End> 211145 </End> </Burst> </Bursts> </File> </MVCResults> Using Exported Data \u00b6 The exported XML can be: Imported back into MVC Calculator for review Used in other analysis software that supports XML Imported into the MuscleMonitor Max patch for real-time sEMG signal normalisation Sending Log Files for Support \u00b6 If you encounter issues or need technical support, you can send your session log file directly from MVC Calculator. This helps support staff diagnose problems more quickly. To send a log file: Click the Send log file button in the console area A dialog will appear where you can optionally add a message describing the issue or any relevant details Enter your message (optional) and click OK A progress indicator will show while the email is being sent You will receive a confirmation message: \"The email was sent successfully\" The log file and your optional message will be sent to the support team for analysis. Figure 7: The Send Log File dialog allows you to add an optional message before sending your session log to support. Importing MVC Calculator XML Files into Max \u00b6 This part of the MuscleMonitor interface allows you to load the MVC values generated by MVC Calculator. These values are used as a normalizing factor so that incoming EMG signals can be normalized in real time. As noted earlier, each .mat file contains recordings from all muscles included in the measurement protocol. For example, if the protocol involves four muscles, each .mat file will always contain four signal channels. In MuscleMonitor, you must therefore match each target muscle to the correct channel. This section of the UI is dedicated to making that mapping clear and easy to configure (see Figure 6 . Figure 6: MuscleMonitor Max interface showing the mvc coefficients section Note Even though the dropdown menu automatically populates the MVC value, this value is not fixed. You can make fine adjustments by editing the number box in the usual way.

Figure 4: MVC Calculator interface displaying sEMG signals extracted from the loaded .mat files. IMPORTANT In most studies, each participant will be fitted with all sensors required by the measurement protocol (typically 4 or 6). As a result, every .mat file contains all sEMG channels for that recording, not just the target muscle. Occasionally, recording errors or mislabelling can make it unclear whether the sensor with the highest amplitude truly corresponds to the target muscle indicated by the filename. MVC Calculator provides a quick visual method to verify that the .mat filename matches the correct sensor channel for the intended muscle. When used alongside a well-defined experimental protocol, MVC Calculator greatly reduces uncertainty and ensures the correct pairing between sensor channels and muscle names.","title":"Navigating Multiple Sensors"},{"location":"user-guide/#signal-processing","text":"MVC Calculator automatically processes sEMG signals using: Bandpass Filtering : Removes noise outside the 10-500 Hz range (default) RMS Calculation : Computes root mean square for signal smoothing Hampel Filtering : Removes outliers and artifacts These processing steps are applied automatically when you load data.","title":"Signal Processing"},{"location":"user-guide/#burst-detection","text":"","title":"Burst Detection"},{"location":"user-guide/#auto-burst-detection-tool","text":"The Auto burst detection tool automatically scans your signal and highlights regions that are likely to contain MVC bursts.

As noted earlier, each .mat file contains recordings from all muscles included in the measurement protocol. For example, if the protocol involves four muscles, each .mat file will always contain four signal channels. In MuscleMonitor, you must therefore match each target muscle to the correct channel. This section of the UI is dedicated to making that mapping clear and easy to configure (see Figure 6 .
