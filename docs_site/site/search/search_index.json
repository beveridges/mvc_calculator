Why do we need to manually identify MVC bursts? \u00b6 You would think that a process like burst identification could be pefromed automatically. However, during the first drum study we ended up with files that were so irregular, they couldn\u2019t be processed automatically. Examples of such irregularities include files with more bursts than required (due to false starts or miscounting), multiple files for the same participant, and noise. By allowing the user to manually define MVC bursts, the MVC Calculator provides a method that is reliable, repeatable, and valid . Summary For all intents and purposes using MVC Calculator is one-and-done process. MATLAB .mat files go in, and an XML file with the MVC values comes out. This will probably be the case 90% of the time. The other 10% can be a pain. MVC Calculator makes dealing with this 10% much more painless. How MVC calculator fits into the workflow. \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 There are currently two builds for Windows and one for Linux. These can be found at https://downloads.moviolabs.com/MVC_Calculator/releases/ . The Windows portable version doesn\u2019t require installtion, but can be slower on startup. The installable version (.msi) is faster because it does most of the time consuming heavy lifting only once during installation. Note During the alpha phase of development MVC Calculator will run with a temporary terminal in the background. This is designed as a troubleshooting tool and should mimic what is shown in the console . of MVC Calculator. Features \u00b6 MATLAB\u00ae .mat file importer Detect and visualize MVC bursts interactively Export processed MVC results data to XML Import XML Adjustable burst thresholds detection function Built-in logging and data management # Overview of the MVC Calculation and implementation The following asteps outline the entire process on implemeneting MVC single normalisation Quick Start \u00b6 Four (or six, depending on the sensor configuration) , .mat files are loaded into the software Open MVC Calculator and load your .mat file from the recording system recorded by Qualisys or Noraxon systems. Use the Energy Detection tool to locate candidate MVC bursts. Fine-tune burst regions using the graphical selector. Press Save Results to store computed MVC metrics. Measurement Protocol By default, MVC Calculator assumes two things: We are following the \u201cbest of 3\u201d procedure (Konrad, 2005). The sEMG sampling frequency is 1500Hz. These settings can be modified by changing the defaults Measurement Protocol Suggestions \u00b6 Perform three maximum-effort trials for each muscle group. Allow sufficient rest (\u2265 30 seconds) between trials. Ensure consistent electrode placement across sessions. Use the same sampling frequency for all measurements. The Interface \u00b6 The interface for MVC Calculator is very simple. It comprises: Menu bar Plotting area Console Main UI controls MVC Calculator UI Quick Start \u00b6 What follows are thea series of videos demonstrating the primary functions of MVC Calculator Scenario 1: Performing the MVC Calculation \u00b6 Making an MVC Calculation is very straight forward, it involves: Importing MATLAB\u00ae files Selecting bursts in the sEMG signal Performing the calculation Exportiong the saved data The following video will demonstrate this process. MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 2: Performing a batch MVC Calculation \u00b6 The majority of the time you will be processing multiple files (In our case four or six sensors). The following video demonstrates this process. The selection of single sEMG bursts is exactly the same as above except there are multiple tabs so multiple selections shoudl be made. Note that the tabs that have not had an active selection will show a red dot when the batchg MVV calculation MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Scenario 3: Importing an XML file \u00b6 XML is the format the system uses to save MVC calculations MVC Calculator \u2013 Video Walkthrough (coming soon) Changing the Defaults \u00b6 You can change the defaults mentioned above by modifying the relative path ./config/defaults.py . Just open the file in any text editor and modify the two numbers corresponding to BEST_OF and DEFAULT_SEMG_FREQUENCY . Tip You can change the \u201cbest of X\u201d rule in the configuration file: ./config/defaults.py \u2192 variable BEST_OF . Note Noraxon / Qualisys record all sensors by default. It\u2019s the user\u2019s responsibility to identify which sensors are relevant for MVC computation. References \u00b6 Konrad, P. (2005).

Solutions : 1. Check System Requirements : - Windows 10 or later (for Windows builds) - Linux with required dependencies (for Linux builds) - Sufficient RAM (4GB minimum recommended) Check License : Ensure you have a valid license.key file installed See License Guide for installation instructions Check Console/Terminal : During alpha phase, a terminal window shows error messages Look for error messages that indicate the problem Reinstall : Try uninstalling and reinstalling the application For portable version, try extracting to a new location Files Won't Load \u00b6 Problem : .mat files don't load or show error messages. Solutions : 1. Verify File Format : - Ensure files are valid MATLAB .mat format - Try opening the file in MATLAB to verify it's not corrupted Check File Path : Avoid very long file paths (Windows limitation) Avoid special characters in file names Ensure you have read permissions for the file File Size : Very large files (>1GB) may take time to load Check the console for progress messages File Structure : Ensure the .mat file contains sEMG data Files from Qualisys or Noraxon should work automatically Other formats may need to match expected structure No Signal Displayed \u00b6 Problem : File loads but no signal appears in the plot. Solutions : 1. Check Data Structure : - The application looks for the first non-metadata variable in the .mat file - Ensure your data variable is properly named Check Sampling Frequency : Default is 1500 Hz If your data uses a different frequency, it may affect display Check config/defaults.py for frequency settings Zoom/Scale Issues : Try zooming out (mouse wheel or toolbar) Signal may be very small or very large Check the console for data range information Multiple Sensors : If you loaded multiple files, check different tabs Each sensor appears as a separate tab Burst Detection Not Working \u00b6 Problem : Energy Detection tool doesn't find bursts or finds too many/few. Solutions : 1. Adjust Parameters : - Minimum Silence Duration : Increase if finding too many bursts - Minimum Sound Duration : Increase to filter out short spikes - Try different combinations of values Signal Quality : Very noisy signals may need manual selection Pre-process your data if it's extremely noisy Check for electrical interference Manual Selection : If automatic detection fails, use manual selection Click and drag on the plot to select burst regions You can select multiple bursts per sensor Can't Select Bursts \u00b6 Problem : Clicking and dragging doesn't create selections. Solutions : 1. Ensure Data is Loaded : - File must be fully loaded before selecting - Check the console for \"File loaded\" messages Check Plot Area : Ensure you're clicking on the signal plot area Try zooming in if the signal is very small Multiple Sensors : Make sure you're on the correct sensor tab Each sensor needs separate selections Clear Previous Selections : Use the clear button (broom icon) if needed Try selecting a different region Processing Fails \u00b6 Problem : Clicking Process/Calculate doesn't work or shows errors. Solutions : 1. Check Selections : - Ensure at least one burst is selected for each sensor - Red indicators show which sensors need selections - Check the console for status messages Multiple Bursts : For \"best of 3\" protocol, select at least 3 bursts The system will find the maximum automatically You can select more than 3 if needed Data Validity : Ensure selected regions contain valid data Avoid selecting regions with artifacts or noise Check that time ranges are reasonable Export/Import Issues \u00b6 Problem : XML files won't export or import correctly. Solutions : 1. File Permissions : - Ensure you have write permissions for export location - Try saving to a different folder (e.g., Desktop) File Format : Ensure you're using .xml extension Don't rename the file extension File Corruption : If import fails, the XML file may be corrupted Try exporting a new file and importing that Check the console for specific error messages Version Compatibility : XML files from older versions may not be compatible Export a new file if you're upgrading versions Console/Log Issues \u00b6 Problem : Console shows errors or doesn't display information. Solutions : 1. Check Log Level : - Some messages are only shown at certain log levels - Errors should always be visible Scroll to Bottom : New messages appear at the bottom Use the scrollbar to see latest messages Send Log : Use the \"Send Log\" button to email logs for support This helps diagnose issues Log File Location : Logs are saved to: %APPDATA%\\MVC_Calculator\\logs\\ Check these files for detailed error information Performance Issues \u00b6 Problem : Application is slow or unresponsive.

What is MVC Calculator? \u00b6 MVC Calculator is software that provides a visual method of idenitfying and annotating bursts in sEMG signals. Why do we need to manually identify MVC bursts? \u00b6 You might expect a process like burst identification to be handled automatically by software. However, during the first drum study we encountered sEMG files that were too irregular for full automation. These irregularities included recordings with extra bursts (caused by false starts or miscounts), duplicate files for the same participant, and excessive noise. To address this, the MVC Calculator allows users to manually define MVC bursts, ensuring a method that is reliable, repeatable, and valid . Summary For all intents and purposes, using MVC Calculator is a one-and-done process: MATLAB .mat files go in, and an XML file with the MVC values comes out. In about 90% of cases, that\u2019s the entire workflow. The remaining 10% can be frustrating due to irregular or problematic files\u2014but MVC Calculator is designed to make handling that difficult 10% far more manageable. How MVC calculator fits into the experimental workflow \u00b6 The implementation of MVC signals is a two-stage process. Stage 1 \u00b6 First, sEMG signals representing the MVC are recorded using Noraxon/Qualisys systems. These signals are then processed in MVC Calculator (see Figure 1 ). As noted earlier, the workflow can involve a combination of automatic and manual steps. Once the processing is complete, the final MVC values are saved in XML format. Figure 1: The Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) recording process. Stage 2 \u00b6 The MVC XML files are imported into Max, where they are used on-the-fly to normalize the incoming live sEMG signals. Once normalized, these signals are then used to drive the biofeedback system\u2014for example, to change the triggered sample. Figure 2 Figure 2: MVC values being used in Max.

This is intentional and serves as a troubleshooting aid, displaying the same diagnostic output shown in the application's console window (see Figure 3 ). Getting Started \u00b6 First Launch \u00b6 When you first launch MVC Calculator, you'll see: Menu Bar - File and Help menus at the top Plotting Area - Large central area for visualizing sEMG signals Console - Bottom panel showing log messages and status Control Buttons - Main action buttons on the interface Figure 3: The MVC Calculator UI. Loading Your First File \u00b6 Click Import MAT files button or use Ctrl+L (or File \u2192 Import MAT files) Navigate to your .mat file location Select one or more files (for batch processing) Click Open The application will load and display your sEMG data in the plotting area. File Operations \u00b6 Importing MAT Files \u00b6 MVC Calculator supports MATLAB .mat files from: Qualisys QTM / Noraxon EMG systems Keyboard Shortcut : Ctrl+L To load mat files: Click Import MAT files or use Ctrl+L (or File \u2192 Import MAT files) Select one or more .mat files The application will automatically detect and load the sEMG data Each file will appear as a separate tab in the plotting area Importing XML Files \u00b6 To load previously saved MVC calculations: Click Import XML file or use Ctrl+X (or File \u2192 Import XML file) Navigate to your saved .xml file Click Open This will restore your previous burst selections and calculated MVC values. Exporting Results \u00b6 After processing your data: Click Export XML file or use Ctrl+E (or File \u2192 Export XML file) Choose a location and filename Click Save The exported XML contains: - Selected burst regions for each sensor - Calculated MVC values - Metadata (timestamps, file paths, etc.) Working with sEMG Data \u00b6 Understanding the User Interface \u00b6 When you load a .mat file, MVC Calculator displays: Signal Plot : The raw or processed sEMG signal over time Sensor Tabs : If multiple sensors are loaded, each appears as a tab Time Axis : Horizontal axis showing time in seconds Amplitude Axis : Vertical axis showing signal amplitude Navigating Multiple Sensors \u00b6 If you've loaded multiple files (e.g., 4 or 6 sensors): Tabs \u2013 Each sensor appears as a tab at the top of the plotting area. EMG channel selection buttons \u2013 These highlighted buttons allow you to select the desired EMG channel. Clear all selections button \u2013 Clears any burst selections made in the active EMG channel. Active EMG channel \u2013 The currently selected sensor is highlighted. Figure 4: MVC Calculator interface displaying sEMG signals extracted from the loaded .mat files. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT In most studies, each participant will be fitted with all sensors required by the measurement protocol (typically 4 or 6). As a result, every .mat file contains all sEMG channels for that recording, not just the target muscle. Occasionally, recording errors or mislabelling can make it unclear whether the sensor with the highest amplitude truly corresponds to the target muscle indicated by the filename. MVC Calculator provides a quick visual method to verify that the .mat filename matches the correct sensor channel for the intended muscle. When used alongside a well-defined experimental protocol, MVC Calculator greatly reduces uncertainty and ensures the correct pairing between sensor channels and muscle names. Signal Processing \u00b6 MVC Calculator automatically processes sEMG signals using: Bandpass Filtering : Removes noise outside the 50-500 Hz range (default) RMS Calculation : Computes root mean square for signal smoothing Hampel Filtering : Removes outliers and artifacts These processing steps are applied automatically when you load data. Burst Detection \u00b6 Energy Detection Tool \u00b6 The Energy Detection tool helps you locate candidate MVC bursts automatically: Click the Energy Detection button (or use the menu) Adjust the detection parameters: Minimum Silence Duration : Time between bursts (default: 80ms) Minimum Sound Duration : Minimum burst length (default: 200ms) Click Detect or Apply The tool will highlight potential burst regions on the plot. Manual Burst Selection \u00b6 After using Energy Detection (or instead of it): Click and Drag : Click on the plot and drag to select a burst region Visual Feedback : Selected regions are highlighted Multiple Selections : You can select multiple bursts per sensor Clear Selection : Use the clear button (broom icon) to remove a selection Selecting Multiple Bursts \u00b6 For the \"best of 3\" protocol: Select your first burst region Select your second burst region Select your third burst region The application will automatically identify the maximum value You can select more than 3 bursts if needed - the system will find the maximum. Processing and Calculations \u00b6 Running the MVC Calculation \u00b6 Once you've selected bursts for all sensors: Review your selections in the console/log area Click the Process or Calculate button The application will: Extract the maximum value from each sensor's selected bursts Calculate the MVC value (typically the peak RMS value) Display results in the console Understanding MVC Values \u00b6 The MVC (Maximum Voluntary Contraction) value represents: - The peak amplitude from your selected burst regions - Used for normalization in subsequent analyses - Typically the highest value from your \"best of 3\" trials Batch Processing \u00b6 When processing multiple sensors: Select bursts for each sensor using the tabs Red indicators will show which sensors still need selections Once all sensors have selections, click Process Results are calculated for all sensors simultaneously Exporting Results \u00b6 XML Export Format \u00b6 The exported XML file contains: <mvc_results> <sensor name= \"EMG_1\" > <burst start= \"1.23\" end= \"2.45\" mvc_value= \"0.456\" /> <burst start= \"5.67\" end= \"6.89\" mvc_value= \"0.512\" /> <burst start= \"10.11\" end= \"11.33\" mvc_value= \"0.489\" /> <max_mvc> 0.512 </max_mvc> </sensor> <!-- Additional sensors... --> </mvc_results> Using Exported Data \u00b6 The exported XML can be: - Imported back into MVC Calculator for review - Used in other analysis software that supports XML - Archived for record-keeping and reproducibility Batch Processing \u00b6 Processing Multiple Files \u00b6 To process multiple sensor files at once: Load all files : Use Import MAT files and select multiple files (or load them one by one) Switch between sensors : Use the tabs or radio buttons Select bursts for each : Make sure each sensor has at least one burst selected Process all : Click Process to calculate MVC values for all sensors Visual Indicators \u00b6 Green/Active Tab : Sensor has burst selections Red Indicator : Sensor needs burst selection before processing Console Messages : Check the console for status of each sensor Tips and Best Practices \u00b6 Data Quality \u00b6 Check Signal Quality : Look for clean, artifact-free regions Avoid Movement Artifacts : Select bursts during stable contractions Consistent Electrode Placement : Ensure electrodes are placed consistently across sessions Selection Strategy \u00b6 Select Clear Peaks : Choose regions with obvious maximum contractions Avoid Noise : Don't select regions with electrical noise or artifacts Consistent Window Size : Try to select bursts of similar duration Workflow Efficiency \u00b6 Use Energy Detection First : Let the tool find candidate regions Fine-tune Manually : Adjust selections as needed Review Before Processing : Check all sensors have selections Save Frequently : Export XML files to preserve your work Troubleshooting \u00b6 No Signal Displayed : Check that your .mat file contains valid sEMG data Can't Select Bursts : Ensure data is loaded and displayed correctly Processing Fails : Verify all sensors have at least one burst selected See the Troubleshooting Guide for more help Keyboard Shortcuts \u00b6 Action Shortcut Import MAT files Ctrl+L Import XML file Ctrl+X Export XML file Ctrl+E Exit Application Ctrl+Q For a complete list, see Keyboard Shortcuts .

Figure 4: MVC Calculator interface displaying sEMG signals extracted from the loaded .mat files. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT In most studies, each participant will be fitted with all sensors required by the measurement protocol (typically 4 or 6). As a result, every .mat file contains all sEMG channels for that recording, not just the target muscle. Occasionally, recording errors or mislabelling can make it unclear whether the sensor with the highest amplitude truly corresponds to the target muscle indicated by the filename. MVC Calculator provides a quick visual method to verify that the .mat filename matches the correct sensor channel for the intended muscle. When used alongside a well-defined experimental protocol, MVC Calculator greatly reduces uncertainty and ensures the correct pairing between sensor channels and muscle names.","title":"Navigating Multiple Sensors"},{"location":"user-guide/#signal-processing","text":"MVC Calculator automatically processes sEMG signals using: Bandpass Filtering : Removes noise outside the 50-500 Hz range (default) RMS Calculation : Computes root mean square for signal smoothing Hampel Filtering : Removes outliers and artifacts These processing steps are applied automatically when you load data.","title":"Signal Processing"},{"location":"user-guide/#burst-detection","text":"","title":"Burst Detection"},{"location":"user-guide/#energy-detection-tool","text":"The Energy Detection tool helps you locate candidate MVC bursts automatically: Click the Energy Detection button (or use the menu) Adjust the detection parameters: Minimum Silence Duration : Time between bursts (default: 80ms) Minimum Sound Duration : Minimum burst length (default: 200ms) Click Detect or Apply The tool will highlight potential burst regions on the plot.","title":"Energy Detection Tool"},{"location":"user-guide/#manual-burst-selection","text":"After using Energy Detection (or instead of it): Click and Drag : Click on the plot and drag to select a burst region Visual Feedback : Selected regions are highlighted Multiple Selections : You can select multiple bursts per sensor Clear Selection : Use the clear button (broom icon) to remove a selection","title":"Manual Burst Selection"},{"location":"user-guide/#selecting-multiple-bursts","text":"For the \"best of 3\" protocol: Select your first burst region Select your second burst region Select your third burst region The application will automatically identify the maximum value You can select more than 3 bursts if needed -
