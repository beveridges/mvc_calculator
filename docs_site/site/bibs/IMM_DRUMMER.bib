  abstract  = {Submaximal reference contractions (RVE) are the state of the art for the normalization of electromyographical (EMG) measures of trapezius muscle. The paper shows difficulties and solution approaches of this method. The EMG of trapezius muscle was measured in 20 nurses and was normalized with submaximal RVE. A significant correlation of rest time and RVE as well as a correlation of the 10th percentile of activity and RVE was found that can cause a systematic falsification of results. Possible solution approaches are the inclusion of RVE into the statistic model, adding a constant value to the data, or exclusion of measures beyond a proposed bandwidth of RVE.},
